This project, created for a Machine Learning course with Stanev D. and Riva R. is a Particle Identification tool created as an alternative to boosted decision trees.\
In the MiniBooNE experiment, electron neutrinos need to be discriminated from tau neutrinos. Using the available data, we have improved this task's accuracy by about one percentage point.\
